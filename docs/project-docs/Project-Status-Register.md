# Project Status Register — agent-learning

> **Purpose:** answer in under a minute: which Phase and Stage is this project at, what just finished, what is
> next. A model resuming after a session or model limit reads this first, then the evidence it cites.
>
> **Not a governed approval artifact** (no `approve-*` policy gates it) and **not append-only**: overwrite in
> place at every natural pause, not only at epic boundaries. It records no approval and certifies no gate.

## 1. Current Orientation (read this first)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Current Phase** | Phase 2, "Advanced Agent Learning with Governance-Integrated Feedback Loops" (ACTIVE; PMP baseline PMP-BL-v1.1.0 formalized). Phase 1 is **CLOSED** (2026-11-06 via PCD-20261106-001; IRP-20261106-001 APPROVED). |
| **Current PMP Baseline** | `PMP-BL-v1.1.0` (`Project-Management-Plan.md` v2.0 formalized via `approve-pmp`, episode `31b88dc3-01fc-4e3f-934e-c0be73a8e372`). All 9 subsidiary management plans (Scope, Schedule, Cost, Resource, Stakeholder Engagement, Communications, Procurement, Quality, Risk) are fully validated and updated to v2.0.0 under `PMP-BL-v1.1.0`. |
| **Session close-off checkpoint** | 2026-11-09. Story 21.5 ("Human Decisions and the Promotion Seed") merged via PR #151 (merge commit `4904328`); `main` is at `a5a0880`. Stage 6 approvals for BRD-024, FDD-024 and Epic 24 stories were accepted and recorded; the approval commit also records the ADR-023/024 downstream documentation. CR-20261109-001 remains a draft pending sponsor/steering committee decision; it does not authorize a baseline change or implementation. Current roll-up: 93 implemented, 39 approved/ready, 25 draft or blocked, 1 superseded, 0 status drift. Next planned Epic 21 story: 21.6 ("Dispatch and Gradient Exclusion"). Epic 22 Story 22.7 was last reported as concurrent work on the paired workstation; confirm its current state before treating it as active. |
| **Current macro Stage** | Phase 1 closed (Stages 11-18 completed). Phase 2 is ACTIVE: **Stages 1 through 8 are COMPLETED & APPROVED**. Active macro stage is **Stage 9: Development / Implementation Pipeline** executing within `src/agent_learning_ext/` and `agent-training-ext/` under Invariant 6 upstream collision protection. |
| **Last Epic/unit of work fully completed** | Milestone M6 (Epic 14: Lightweight Critique-to-Evidence Ingestion Engine) 100% complete across all 6 stories (39/39 tests passed, PR #121 merged). Epic 16 (Deterministic UCB Decision Policy) 100% complete across all 6 stories (62/62 tests passed, PR #130 merged, Step 9 recap complete). Milestone M7 (Epic 18: Pairwise Preference Optimization) 100% complete across all 6 stories (36/36 tests passed, PR #128 merged, Step 9 recap complete). Milestone M8 (Epic 17: Scheduled Epsilon-Greedy Policy Baseline) 100% complete across all 6 stories (60/60 tests passed, PR #138 merged, Step 9 recap complete). Pre-Flight Spec Gate and Bayesian PR Gate operational on `main`. |
| **Next Epic/unit of work to implement** | Epic 21 (Contextual Authority Ensemble Routing) / Milestone M9: Story 21.5 is merged; Story 21.6 is next. Epic 22 Story 22.7 was last reported as concurrent paired-workstation work; its state is unverified locally. Epic 23 and Epic 24 implementation remain blocked pending the required scope authorization and story-specific prerequisites. |
| **Last commit on the base branch** | `a5a0880` — ADR-023/024 downstream approval documentation and governance records. Most recent story merge: PR #151, merge commit `4904328` (2026-11-09). |
| **Open side-thread outside the formal loop** | (1) `scripts/spec_gate.py` and `scripts/pr_gate.py` operational on `agent-learning` and propagated to `sidpa-template` (`master` commit `b6367d8`). (2) CR-20261109-001 is pending sponsor/steering committee decision; no baseline change is authorized. (3) Epic 23/24 implementation is blocked pending baseline authorization and their stated prerequisites. |
| **Stage numbering** | The 18 stages are numbered as in sidpa-template `docs/chain-coverage.md`, which is the source of truth; this repo's `docs/intent-to-outcome-chain-coverage.md` follows it (aligned in the governance-alignment PR). Confirm a position against gate records and registers, never a document's own `lifecycle_stage` (template rule 24). Vault notes carry authoring-time labels only. |

## 2. Phase Status

| Phase | Baseline | Status | Closed via |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1: Warm-Start & Confidence-Interval Bandits | `PMP-BL-v1.0.0` | **CLOSED** | **2026-11-06 via PCD-20261106-001** (Stage 18 Intent Refinement COMPLETED, IRP-20261106-001 APPROVED, Phase 2 READY) |
| Phase 2: Advanced Agent Learning with Governance-Integrated Feedback Loops | `PMP-BL-v1.1.0` | **ACTIVE** | Formalized via `approve-pmp` (Episode `31b88dc3...`) |

## 3. Epic/Unit-of-Work Status (all phases)

Not copied here, so it cannot drift: it is generated from `docs/user-stories/epic-*.md` and `implementation-log.md` by `python scripts/phase_rollup.py` (PR #108) and ingested into the Obsidian brain as `Phase-Carry-Over-Backlog`. The latest roll-up reports 158 stories: 93 implemented, 39 approved and Ready but not implemented, 25 Draft or blocked, 1 superseded, and 0 status-drift rows (`--check` exits 0). The per-story detail stays in the generated roll-up and source story/log files. Milestones M6 (Epic 14), M7 (Epic 18), and M8 (Epic 17) are fully implemented. Stories 21.1–21.5 and 22.1–22.6 are implemented.

## 4. How to keep this current

- **After every Epic's Step 9 recap** (`implement-story`): update §1 ("Last … completed", "Next … to implement", "Session close-off checkpoint").
- **Before starting a new Epic's first story:** confirm "Next … to implement" matches what is about to be worked on.
- **At every Stage 17/18 Phase close:** update §2 and add the new Phase's row.
- **At any natural pause**, not only at epic boundaries: a decision made, a correction applied, before work that takes many steps. A model or session limit does not announce itself.
- **Out-of-loop work** gets one line in "Open side-thread"; do not invent an Epic or Story for it.
- **Confirming a position here:** use merged PRs and commits, `implementation-log.md`, the registers, and the gate episodes in the store at `AGENT_LEARNING_LOCAL_STORE_DIR` (print the resolved path first, `LL-040`; on this machine it points at the socialengage store). Audit records go in `docs/registers/Audit-Register.md` (first audit AUDIT-001 to AUDIT-006 approved 2026-11-04, a bounded sample).
- Not append-only, no version bump per edit: only `last_updated` changes.
